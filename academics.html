	<p>Some of the ups this year is I've met and befriended quite a few new people this year I never thought I'd meet and I've done a lot of useful work this year. Some of the downs, however, have been that this year has been a little bit tough; more than last year & it's a bit hard to follow all my classes all at once</p>
